# Full Stack API Project Documentation

## Full Stack Trivia

###Introduction
The team at Udacity created the starter code for this API frontend and
backend. I helped complete the API endpoints and tests for Flask. I want to
learn more about backend development, so I began this project as a way to
practice those skills.

The Python code in this project follows PEP8 style guides.

###Getting started

  -Set up the virtual environment for Python by running `pip install env`
  -Run the activate script for the virtual environment (see this guide:
    https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/ for more help)
  -Install project dependencies by running `pip install requests`  
  -In the backend folder, run `export FLASK_APP=flaskr`,
    `export FLASK_ENV=development`, and `flask run` from the terminal to run the backend development server
  -Navigate to the frontend folder and install node and npm if necessary
  -Run `npm install` to download node_modules
  -Run `npm start` to start the frontend server
  -Note: if you get any errors after running npm start, follow the instructions
    to try to fix that error. If that doesn't work, you can create an .env file
    with the text `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` to resolve the error. However,
    this could cause issues later on so it is better to try the other solutions
    recommended in the npm messages.
  -Using any browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the frontend
    while also running the backend server at http://localhost:5000
  -You can now view different parts of the site, make changes to the
    database from the frontend, and play the trivia game
    Have fun!
